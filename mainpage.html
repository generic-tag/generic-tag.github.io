	<h1>My favorite vacation destinations</h1>

   		<h2>Jeju Island (Jeju-do)</h2>

			<br>
			<p>Jeju-do is an island off the southern coast of South Korea. I've been there multiple times</p>
			<p>with my family,and I enjoygoing there every time. It's primarily known for its natural</p>
			<p>lanscapes such as its beaches, mountains, lakes, etc. It also has a very sweet oramge called</p>
			<p>"Hallabong". The latitude of Jeju-do is around the same as Los Angeles, but it can get a lot</p>
			<p>more humid. I would recommend going there if you're ever in Korea.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h2>Big Sur</h2>

			<br>
			<p>Big Sur, and its surrounding areas, was another one of my favorite places to visit while on</p>
			<p>vacation. I enjoy its scenery, both on the way there and while there. Even though the direct</p>
			<p>route is still closed due to the <a href="https://www.ksby.com/news/local-news/hwy-1-along-big-sur-coastline-remains-closed-after-three-months-of-closure"><u><b>landslide on Pacific Coast Highway</b></u></a>, the alternate doesn't</p>
			<p>take too much time. One thing that I like to do while there is taking photographs of the</p>
			<p>sea and the land surrounding it. However, cell reception will be spotty at best in some</p>
			<p>areas, and no signal in other areas.</p>
