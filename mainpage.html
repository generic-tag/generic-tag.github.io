			<p>Jeju-do is an island off the southern coast of South Korea. I've been there multiple times</p>
			<p>with my family,and I enjoygoing there every time. It's primarily known for its natural</p>
			<p>lanscapes such as its beaches, mountains, lakes, etc. It also has a very sweet oramge called</p>
			<p>"Hallabong". The latitude of Jeju-do is around the same as Los Angeles, but it can get a lot</p>
			<p>more humid. I would recommend going there if you're ever in Korea.</p>
